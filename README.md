# 1) AI FINAL PROJECT: STOCK MARKET TRADING APP
The Stock Market Trading App uses yfinance to fetch historical stock data for Apple, Google, or Amazon. It then employs Prophet for forecasting future stock prices based on the chosen number of years. The app displays the forecasted stock prices, calculates the number of shares that can be bought with a specified investment amount, and provides a recommendation to either "Buy" or "Sell" the stock based on the forecasted price compared to the last closing price.
# 2) AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION OPTIMIZATION
In this we have compared different ML algorithms to find the prediction accuracy of different crops using different ML models, weâ€™ve selected the kNN classifier algorithm as the final algorithm to predict which crop is best suitable for the given set of conditions.
# 3) CATS VS DOG CLASSIFICATION
